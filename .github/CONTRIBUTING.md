# Contributing to Modmail

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

If you are proposing new features, please discuss them with us in the [development server](https://discord.gg/cnUpwrnpYb) before you start working on them!

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Git Flow](https://atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

When contributing to this project, please make sure you follow this and name your branches appropriately! 

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Make sure you know how Git Flow works before contributing! 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` or `development` according to Git Flow.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.
3. If you've changed `core/*` or `bot.py`, mark changelog as "BREAKING" since plugins may break.
4. Make sure your code passes the lint checks.
5. Create Issues and pull requests!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using [Github Issues](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new Issue](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Find pre-existing issues to tackle
Check out our [unstaged issue tracker](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Astaged) and start helping out!

Ways to help out:
- Help out new members
- Highlight invalid bugs/unsupported use cases
- Code review of pull requests
- Add on new use cases or reproduction steps
- Point out duplicate issues and guide them to the right direction
- Create a pull request to resolve the issue!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What *actually* happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use [black](https://github.com/python/black) for a unified code style.
